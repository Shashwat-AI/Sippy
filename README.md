# Sippy

A lightweight, easy to use PHP Framework for building websites and web apps.

# Documentation

Sippyâ€™s architecture bares striking resemblance to  Codeigniter, so we call it a lightweight PHP framework. However, remember that because Sippy is lightweight, it does not include a lot of the functionality that comes with Codeigniter.  Maybe we can add "plug-n-play" functionality via plug-ins, controllers, and libraries.

# Model-View-Controller

Sippy is based on the Model-View-Controller development pattern.
